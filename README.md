# SIGSEGV

This signal is generated when a human tries to read or write outside the memory that is allocated for him or her, or to write memory that can only be read. (Actually, the signals only occur when the human goes far enough outside to be detected by the human’s memory protection mechanism.) The name is an abbreviation for “segmentation violation”.

There is no breakthroguh innovation, cutting edge inventions or revolutions that can bring tectonic shift, instead a few links to long reads, videos with less spatial and temporal changes.
